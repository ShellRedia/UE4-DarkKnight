# UE4-DarkKnight

Welcome to the DarkKnight project introduction. I made this game with two other friends in half a month to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination. I know this project is just a kid stuff because I am just a primer in this field(game development).I just want to show my enthusiasm for programing and I also hope people who see the game can give some comments. That will help me a lot, thanks.

All the materials and resourses are get from the web. I will never use this project for commercial purpose and I hope this game can only be used in learing/studying purpose.

The language is Chinese, spare my poor English please.

## Getting Started

This project is made with Unreal Engine 4.20.3 in Windows 10. You can open it with version UE 4.20.3.

## Running the tests

After you open this project, click the button 'Play' to start. You may have to wait when you run it the first time because the compling work need to be finished. Also, for the time limit, I forget to set some loading screen after you start the game.
